Breaking down the overall process into context-specific Mermaid diagrams for each major functionality—GitHub repository logic, Salesforce functionality with scheduling, and the committing/saving process—is a great idea. This approach allows for a modular understanding of each component, making it easier to digest and follow. Additionally, if you plan to create a click-through UI, having individual diagrams for each context can enhance interactivity and user engagement by providing focused insights into each process.

### GitHub Repository Logic

This diagram could illustrate the decision process involved in checking for an existing repository, creating a new one if necessary, and setting up the initial documentation structure.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Check if Repository Exists}
    B -- Yes --> C[Use Existing Repository]
    B -- No --> D[Create New Repository from Template]
    D --> E[Setup Documentation Structure]
    E --> F[End]
```

### Salesforce Functionality with Scheduling

This diagram can focus on fetching metadata from Salesforce, deciding whether updates are needed, and potentially using GitHub Actions or Salesforce Apex scheduled jobs for automation.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Query Salesforce for Metadata]
    B --> C{Is New or Updated Metadata?}
    C -- Yes --> D[Generate Documentation Updates]
    C -- No --> E[No Action Needed]
    D --> F[Schedule Next Audit]
    F -->|GitHub Actions| G[Automate with GitHub Actions]
    F -->|Salesforce Apex Jobs| H[Automate with Salesforce Scheduled Jobs]
    G --> I[End]
    H --> I
```

### Committing Process and Saving

This diagram outlines the steps for committing the generated documentation to the GitHub repository and saving updates.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Generate Documentation Content]
    B --> C[Store Content in Cloud]
    C --> D[Update GitHub Repository]
    D --> E[Create Pull Request for Review]
    E --> F{Review Completed?}
    F -- Yes --> G[Merge Pull Request]
    F -- No --> E
    G --> H[End]
```

### Actionable Contexts for Individual Diagrams

1. **GitHub Repository Logic:** Focuses on repository existence, creation, and initial setup.
2. **Salesforce Functionality and Scheduling:** Concentrates on the interaction with Salesforce for metadata, decision-making on updates, and automation options.
3. **Committing Process and Saving:** Deals with the documentation generation, cloud storage, and the GitHub committing process including reviews.

By designing individual diagrams for these contexts, you provide a clear and focused view of each part of the system. Users can explore each aspect independently or understand how they connect in the broader application workflow, especially when integrated into a clickable UI for enhanced exploration.

This approach not only aids in comprehension but also in the modular development and potential troubleshooting of the system, as it clearly delineates the boundaries and responsibilities of different parts of your application.
