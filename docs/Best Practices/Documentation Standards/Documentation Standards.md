# Documentation Standards

Documentation is a critical part of the software development process. It is the primary means of communication between developers, and between developers and users. It is also a valuable resource for future developers who need to understand the code base. Good documentation is clear, concise, and easy to navigate. It should be written with the audience in mind, and should be updated regularly to reflect changes in the code base. This document outlines the standards for documentation at Acme Corporation.

## 5 Ws of Documentation Standards

The 5 Ws of Documentation Standards are important to understand the purpose and use of documentation standards. The 5 Ws are:

1. **What**: What is documentation standards?
   What is a documentation standard? A documentation standard is a set of rules and guidelines that developers should follow when writing documentation. The purpose of a documentation standard is to ensure that documentation is clear, concise, and easy to navigate, and to promote best practices in documentation. A documentation standard can cover a wide range of topics, including formatting, organization, and versioning.

2. **Why**: Why are documentation standards important?
   Documentation standards are important because they help to ensure that documentation is clear, concise, and easy to navigate. Consistent documentation is easier to read and understand, which makes it easier to maintain and use. Documentation standards also help to promote best practices in documentation, which can improve the quality and reliability of the documentation.

3. **When**: When should documentation standards be used?
   Documentation standards should be used whenever documentation is being written or modified. It is important to follow documentation standards from the beginning of a project, so that all documentation is clear, concise, and easy to navigate. It is also important to follow documentation standards when making changes to existing documentation, so that the changes are consistent with the rest of the documentation.

4. **Where**: Where should documentation standards be used?
   Documentation standards should be used in any development environment where documentation is being written or modified. This includes both individual and team development environments. Documentation standards should also be used in code reviews, to ensure that all documentation is clear, concise, and easy to navigate.

5. **Who**: Who should use documentation standards?
   Documentation standards should be used by all developers who are writing or modifying documentation. It is important for all developers to follow documentation standards, so that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to navigate. Documentation standards should also be used by code reviewers, to ensure that all documentation is clear, concise, and easy to navigate.

## Documentation Types

There are several types of documentation that are commonly used in software development. The following are the most common types of documentation:

1. **Technical Documentation**: Technical documentation is used to describe the architecture, design, and implementation of a software system. It includes specifications, diagrams, and other technical details that are used by developers to understand and maintain the code base.

2. **User Documentation**: User documentation is used to describe how to use a software system. It includes user guides, tutorials, and other materials that are used by end users to learn how to use the software.

3. **API Documentation**: API documentation is used to describe the application programming interface (API) of a software system. It includes reference guides, tutorials, and other materials that are used by developers to integrate with the software.

4. **Release Notes**: Release notes are used to describe the changes that have been made in a software system. They include information about new features, bug fixes, and other changes that have been made in a release.

## Documentation Standards

The following are the standards for documentation at Acme Corporation:

1. **Consistency**: All documentation should be consistent in style, format, and content. This includes using the same terminology, formatting, and organization across all documentation.

2. **Clarity**: All documentation should be clear and easy to understand. This includes using simple language, avoiding jargon, and providing clear explanations of technical concepts.

3. **Conciseness**: All documentation should be concise and to the point. This includes avoiding unnecessary details, and focusing on the most important information.

4. **Relevance**: All documentation should be relevant to the audience. This includes tailoring the content to the needs of the audience, and avoiding unnecessary information.

5. **Accessibility**: All documentation should be easily accessible to the audience. This includes providing multiple formats, such as HTML, PDF, and printed copies, and ensuring that the documentation is easy to navigate.

6. **Accuracy**: All documentation should be accurate and up to date. This includes ensuring that the information is correct, and updating the documentation regularly to reflect changes in the code base.

7. **Organization**: All documentation should be well organized and easy to navigate. This includes using headings, lists, and other formatting to make the documentation easy to read.

8. **Versioning**: All documentation should be versioned to reflect changes in the code base. This includes using version numbers, release dates, and other information to indicate the version of the documentation.

## Documentation Tools

The following are the tools that are commonly used for documentation at Acme Corporation:

1. **Markdown**: Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to write documentation. It is easy to read and write, and can be converted to HTML, PDF, and other formats.

2. **Git**: Git is a version control system that is used to manage documentation. It provides features such as branching, merging, and tagging, which are useful for managing different versions of documentation.

3. **Jekyll**: Jekyll is a static site generator that is used to publish documentation. It provides features such as templates, layouts, and includes, which are useful for creating a consistent and easy to navigate documentation site.

4. **GitHub Pages**: GitHub Pages is a web hosting service that is used to publish documentation. It provides features such as custom domains, HTTPS, and Jekyll integration, which are useful for hosting documentation sites.

## Conclusion

Good documentation is a critical part of the software development process. It is the primary means of communication between developers, and between developers and users. It is also a valuable resource for future developers who need to understand the code base. By following the standards outlined in this document, developers at Acme Corporation can create clear, concise, and easy to navigate documentation that is useful for all stakeholders.
