    **Objective**: Ensure new employees feel welcomed, understand their role, and are integrated into the team.
    
    - **Day 1**: Orientation with HR, introduction to the team, and workstation setup.
    - **Day 2-5**: Role-specific training, including Salesforce basics. Begin shadowing team members on current projects.
    - **End of Week 1**: Review with manager to discuss observations, answer questions, and set expectations.
    - **Week 2**: Deep dive into ongoing projects, more hands-on tasks, and introduction to client-facing work (if applicable).
    - **End of Week 2**: Feedback session with manager to assess integration, clarify doubts, and plan for upcoming weeks.
    
    **Key Focus Areas**: Salesforce training, team integration, role understanding, and initial project involvement.
    **Success Criteria**: Positive feedback from the employee, clear understanding of role and projects, and active participation in team activities.
    **Note**: This plan is a general guideline and may be adjusted based on the employee's role and team dynamics.
